Wheel of Fortune

The core game is based on Hangman.

Each round has a category and a blank word puzzle, with each blank representing a letter in the answer.

A roulette-style wheel with 24 spaces, most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900, plus a top dollar value: $2,500 in Round 1, $3,500 in Rounds 2 and 3, and $5,000 for Round 4 and any subsequent rounds. The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn, both of which forfeit the contestant's turn, with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round.

Each game features three contestants; each contestant is positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper. The left scoreboard from the viewer's perspective is colored red, the center yellow, and the right blue.

A contestant spins the wheel to determine a dollar value and guess a consonant. Calling a correct letter earns the value before the corresponding flipper, multiplied by the number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. A contestant with at least $250 may buy a vowel for a flat rate of that amount, until all the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed.

Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise from the viewer's perspective if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, or if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or gives an incorrect answer.

The total winnings of the three contestants are compared; the contestant with the highest total winnings wins the game. If two or all three contestants are tied for first place at the end of the round, an additional toss-up puzzle is played between the tied contestants. The contestant who solves the toss-up puzzle wins the game



Bonus round

The winner advances to the bonus round. In the bonus round, the winning contestant is given a category, and a puzzle for which every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed; after providing three more consonants and a vowel, the contestant has ten seconds to attempt solving the puzzle.
